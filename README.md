Graduate course at the University of Victoria. Statistical Analysis of Administrative Health and Linked Longitudinal Encounter Data.

# Course description

This course will focus on types and sources of administrative health data and on the permissions, acquisition, management, and statistical analysis of administrative health and linked longitudinal encounter data. Analyses will cover a range of methods, including descriptive statistics, longitudinal trajectories, visualization of encounter timelines, multilevel modeling of within-person change, growth mixture models, and predictive models to quantify risk of future health events. This course will lead to an ongoing collaborative interdisciplinary research group, including data, policy, and statistical analysis experts. Simulated data from Island Health will be used for purposes of this course (signed non-disclosure agreement required for access to information and analysis tools).

# Prerequisites 

Basic familiarity with R is recommended. While we do not exclude other statistical packages, the primary data handling, modeling, and graphing will be written out in R scripts. Student engagement with the data and models will take place via RStudio. Students will be expected to learn how to read, modify, and apply existing R scripts to perform data manipulation, model estimation, and publish results as dynamic documents.
