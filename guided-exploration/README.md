Practical component guide.  
=========
 
- GE1 – Location Mapping: EHR Addresses and Class Compressors  
- GE2 – Patient Event Table: Sequencing encounters with the Service System  
- GE3 – Mapped Encounters: Cohort Summary and Timeline Visualization  
- _Lab1 – Cohort Summary and Timeline Visualization_  
- GE4 – Flattened Encounter Timelines: Quantifying Service Engagement  
- GE5 – Statistical Models for Evaluating Encounter Profiles  
- _Lab2 – Patterns of Service Utilization_  


The practical component of the course will consist of 5 guided explorations (GE) and 2 labs. 
A guided exploration is walking through an R script that performs a particular set manipulations and analyses of data relevant for that topic. The learners are expected to demonstrate the reproduction of these scripts using prosthetic data on their machines and contribute to script development.  Each lab applies the skills and knowledge from preceding guided explorations and focuses on organizing and publishing a dynamic report that carries the argument of the analysis by providing the language of discourse and demonstrating the evidence for purported conclusions.  The documents created in the labs will be submitted for grading and evaluation. While feedback will be provided on each report, they will be graded on pass/fail scale and contribute to 30% of their course grade. 
 
**Prerequisites**: basic familiarity with R. While we do not exclude other statistical packages, the primary data handling, modeling, and graphing will be written out in R scripts. Student engagement with the data and models will take place via RStudio. Students will be expected to learn reading and applying existing R scripts to perform data manipulation, model estimation, and publishing results as dynamic documents.  
Each of the GE will be related to the following rubrics: 
- **Overview**: What happens at this stage of analytic work flow?
- **Questions**: what questions should you be able to answer?
- **Skills**: what analytic or technical skills does it require?
- **Learning Objectives**: what specific knowledge or skill should be acquired?
- **Glossary**: what terms and concepts are central to this stage?
